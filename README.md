## Hiragana
It is possible to view the common hiragana character matrix, and it is also possible to train these.
The ones that you answer incorrectly can be tried again until you pass all.

## TODO/Roadmap/Ideas
- Katakana
- Digraphs (kya, sha, cha, nya, hya, mya, rya, etc.)
- Diacritics (ga, za, da, ba, pa, etc) 
- Digraphs with diacritics (gya, ja, ja, bya, pya, etc.)
- Select characters (starting consonants and/or vowels) to train?
