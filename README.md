# Kana

Train the 46 nucleus kana of hiragana and katakana, respectively.

Try it: https://daghall.github.io/kana/


## Usage
It is possible to view the common kana character matrix, and it is also possible to train these.
The ones that you answer incorrectly can be tried again until you pass all.

## TODO/Roadmap/Ideas
- Digraphs (kya, sha, cha, nya, hya, mya, rya, etc.)
- Diacritics (ga, za, da, ba, pa, etc) 
- Digraphs with diacritics (gya, ja, ja, bya, pya, etc.)
- Select characters (starting consonants and/or vowels) to train?
